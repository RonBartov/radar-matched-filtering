# Radar Matched Filtering

## About the Project

This repository provides a complete simulation for radar signal processing using matched filtering. It demonstrates how rectangular and LFM (linear frequency modulation) pulses behave in time and frequency domains, and how matched filters can enhance signal detection under noisy conditions. The simulation includes several thresholding techniques for target detection, showcasing their effectiveness through detailed plots.

## Built With

- MATLAB
- Signal processing concepts (matched filtering, LFM, SNR improvement)
- Custom MATLAB functions and plotting classes

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:RonBartov/radar-matched-filtering.git
   cd radar-matched-filtering
   ```

2. Open MATLAB in this folder.

3. Run the main script:
   ```matlab
   main.m
   ```
